[x] 2+ 'planets' orbiting sun
[x] orbiting 'moons' for at least two planets
[x] something orbiting a moon
[ ] colored XYZ axes
[x] at least one object built by vertices
[x] at least one object from an obj

Textures
[x] At least one texture by me
[x] At least one texture from the book
[x] At least one open source texture
Controls
[x] w – move the camera forward a small amount (i.e. in the positive-N direction).
s – move the camera backward a small amount (i.e. in the negative-N direction).
[x] a – move the camera a small amount in the negative-U direction (also called “strafe left”).
[x] d – move the camera a small amount in the positive-U direction (also called “strafe right”).
[x] e – move the camera a small amount in the negative-V direction (“move down”).
[x] q – move the camera a small amount in the positive-V direction (“move up”).
[ ] left and right arrow – rotate the camera by a small amount left/right around its V axis (“pan”).
[ ] up and down arrow – rotate the camera by a small amount up/down around its U axis (“pitch).
[x] <space bar> - toggle the visibility of the world axes.

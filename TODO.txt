Textures
[ ] At least one texture by me

Controls
[ ] w – move the camera forward a small amount (i.e. in the positive-N direction).
s – move the camera backward a small amount (i.e. in the negative-N direction).
[ ] a – move the camera a small amount in the negative-U direction (also called “strafe left”).
[ ] d – move the camera a small amount in the positive-U direction (also called “strafe right”).
[ ] e – move the camera a small amount in the negative-V direction (“move down”).
[ ] q – move the camera a small amount in the positive-V direction (“move up”).
[ ] left and right arrow – rotate the camera by a small amount left/right around its V axis (“pan”).
[ ] up and down arrow – rotate the camera by a small amount up/down around its U axis (“pitch).
[ ] <space bar> - toggle the visibility of the world axes.
